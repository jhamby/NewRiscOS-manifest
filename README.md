# NewRiscOS repo manifest

This project contains the repo manifest for `NewRiscOS`, a port of RISC OS
to 64-bit ARM CPUs, using C translations of the original `ObjAsm` 32-bit ARM
assembly source code, building on top of the seL4 microkernel.

See the `README.md` file in the `NewRiscOS` repo for build instructions.
